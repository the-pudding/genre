But before we get too analytical, let’s start with something for the casual music fans."}]},{"slide":"6","section":"2","text":[{"type":"p","text":"In 2023, nearly half of the top 25 genres hail from <strong class=secondary>Latin America, Africa, and Asia.</strong>"}]},{"slide":"7","section":"2","text":[{"type":"p","text":"This shouldn’t be surprising."},{"type":"p","text":"Today, Spotify users from North America and Europe represent a much smaller share of streams than in 2016."}]},{"slide":"8","section":"2","text":[{"type":"p","text":"Every year, Spotify is available in more countries.

But does k-pop feel popular because we’re seeing more signal from different music fans? Is reggaeton seemingly pervasive because we’re finally counting the true popularity of English-centric artists?"},{"type":"p","text":"Popularity is such a self-fulfilling loop: we obsess over what’s popular (especially in the US), pushing top-charting artists further into the cultural spotlight."}]},{"slide":"13","section":"2","text":[{"type":"p","text":"So is the recent shift in music taste real?
