00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:03.569
We do recognize the existence
of genres that are mainly driven

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:07.360
by listening patterns and not
necessarily by the artists thinking

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.207
of themselves as being peers.

00:00:09.213 --> 00:00:13.410
We can find clusters of listeners
who share  fondness for the

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.748
same artists, even when it's not
necessarily obvious that those

00:00:16.748 --> 00:00:21.785
artists share a style, and they don't
necessarily come from the same place.

00:00:22.205 --> 00:00:27.442
But we can see that, yes, fans of these
artists tend to be fans of the others.
