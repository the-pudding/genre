1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,569
We do recognize the existence
of genres that are mainly driven

2
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:07,360
by listening patterns and not
necessarily by the artists thinking

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,207
of themselves as being peers.

4
00:00:09,213 --> 00:00:13,410
We can find clusters of listeners
who share  fondness for the

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,748
same artists, even when it's not
necessarily obvious that those

6
00:00:16,748 --> 00:00:21,785
artists share a style, and they don't
necessarily come from the same place.

7
00:00:22,205 --> 00:00:27,442
But we can see that, yes, fans of these
artists tend to be fans of the others.
