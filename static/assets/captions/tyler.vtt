It sucks that whenever we, and I
mean guys that look like me, do

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:08.579 line:-4 position:50%,align:left size:90%
anything that's genre bending they
always put it in a rap or urban.

00:00:08.588 --> 00:00:09.298 line:-4 position:50%,align:left size:90%
category.

00:00:09.658 --> 00:00:10.738 line:-4 position:50%,align:left size:90%
I don't like that urban word.

00:00:10.738 --> 00:00:13.351 line:-4 position:50%,align:left size:90%
It's just a politically correct
way to say the N word to me.

00:00:13.661 --> 00:00:17.251 line:-4 position:50%,align:left size:90%
So when I hear that, I'm just
like, why can't we just be in pop?

00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:21.291 line:-4 position:50%,align:left size:90%
Half of me feels like the rap
nomination was a backhanded compliment.

00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:25.341 line:-4 position:50%,align:left size:90%
Like, Oh, uh, my little
cousin wants to play the game.

00:00:25.341 --> 00:00:29.381 line:-4 position:50%,align:left size:90%
Let's give him the unplugged controller so
he could shut up and feel good about it.
